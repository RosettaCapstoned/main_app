# Rosetta Capstone 

### What and why
Rosetta Capstone is a real time interactive learning platform. It’s primarily used to teach users a language they want to learn via a real instructor. The instructor will stream themselves teaching and speaking a particular language. The audio stream will be translated in real time and displayed in the form of text on screen for the students. Each student will see text in the language they selected themselves.

In today’s world, an education can be the difference between prosperity and poverty. With all of us being children of immigrants, we know this reality well. Moving to a new country and not knowing the native language is not only scary but it is also a barrier to one’s financial success.
