           Rosetta Capstone is a <b>real time interactive learning platform</b>. Itâ€™s primarily used to teach users a language they want to learn via a real instructor. The instructor will stream themselves teaching and speaking a particular language. The audio stream will be translated in real time and displayed in the form of text on screen for the students.
